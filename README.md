# Meetup Spaces in India
If you are an organizer of Meetups like me then I am sure before planning every meetup the first question comes on your mind is  - "But where we will host the meetup?". Getting the space is always a challenge. It becomes more challenging when you go to new city to do the Meetup. Here are the list of the co-working places who would be happy to host the Meetup.

Happy Meetup!!
